### Hey there, friend! 👋🏻

I'm Andy. You can find me primarily on <a rel="me" href="https://macaw.social/@andypiper">Mastodon</a> (but I am also in other places in the #Fediverse). I help the [Mastodon project](https://github.com/mastodon) with Developer Relations and community.

I'm a maker at [Forge & Craft](https://forgeandcraft.co.uk), and I attend and help out with the [Makeroni](https://makeroni.cc) pop-up hackspace meetup.

📑 [Glitch in Bio](https://andypiper.me) (it's like "Link in Bio" via Linktree etc, but _free_, and [yours to improve](https://dev.to/andypiper/a-quick-glitch-bio-break-1c6a)!)

### Hey there, friend! 👋🏻

I'm Andy. You can find me primarily on <a rel="me" href="https://macaw.social/@andypiper">Mastodon</a> (but I am also in other places in the #Fediverse). I help the [Mastodon project](https://github.com/mastodon) with Developer Relations and community. I'm also an Ambassador for [OpenUK](https://openuk.uk).

I'm a maker at [Forge & Craft](https://forgeandcraft.co.uk), and I attend and help out with the [Makeroni](https://makeroni.cc) pop-up hackspace meetup.

📑 [Glitch in Bio](https://andypiper.me) (it's like "Link in Bio" via Linktree etc, but _free_, and [yours to improve](https://dev.to/andypiper/a-quick-glitch-bio-break-1c6a)!)

💖 [OMG](https://andypiper.omg.lol)

- I sometimes write longer things on [DEV](https://dev.to/andypiper), [Medium](https://andypiper.medium.com), or on [my own website](https://andypiper.co.uk). 
- I have [a newsletter](https://buttondown.email/andypiper) 📮 which gets sent to subscribers on an occasional basis. 
- I'm one of the co-hosts of the weekly technology podcast 🎙️ [Games at Work dot biz](https://gamesatwork.biz) - you can find us on all of the major podcast directories. Let us know what you think!

In terms of code beyond GitHub, I have a [RoutineHub profile](https://routinehub.co/user/andypiper) for Apple Shortcuts. I also use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@andypiper) and [Replit](https://replit.com/@andypiper) as platforms for quick apps and demos.
